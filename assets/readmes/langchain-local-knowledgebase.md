# Open AI GPT, Langchain, OpenSearch and Unstructured

This code utilizes Open AI GPT, Langchain, Redis Cache, OpenSearch and Unstructured to fetch content from URLs, sitemap, PDF, Powerpoint, Notion doc and images to create embeddings/vectors and save them in a local OpenSearch database. The created collections can then be used with GPT to answer questions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, copy the `.env` file and set up required environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

To create the containers, install the required dependencies and launch the server, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

This should create the following containers:
✔ Container redis (cache)
✔ Container unstructured (handle images, ppt, text, markdown)
✔ Container opensearch (search engine)
✔ Container opensearch-dashboards  (search engine dashboard)

OpenSearch dashboard can be accessed at http://localhost:5601

Install dependencies and start the server (app.js)

The server will listen on the port specified in the `.env` file (default is 3000).

## Using ngrok

To allow access to the app externally using the port set in the `.env` file, you can use ngrok. Follow the steps below:

1. Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Run `ngrok http <port>` in your terminal (replace `<port>` with the port set in your `.env` file)
3. Copy the ngrok URL generated by the command and use it in your Voiceflow Assistant API step.

This can be handy if you want to quickly test this in an API step within your Voiceflow Assistant.
